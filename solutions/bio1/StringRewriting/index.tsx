      <STitle>Idea</STitle>
      <SText>
        Note $2^31 > 10^9$, therefore a bruteforce approach won't work. 
        Let $A[i], B[i], C[i], D[i], E[i]$ each respectively denote the result of $i$ operations applied to $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ and $E$.

        From caseworking by hand, the following could be observed: 
      </SText>
      <SList>
        <SText>$A[i] = A[i-1] + A[i-2]$</SText>
        <SText>$B[i] = A[i+1]$</SText>
        <SText>$C[i] = C[i-1] + D[i-1]</SText>
        <SText>$D[i] = D[i-1] + C[i-1]</SText>
        <SText>$E[i] = E[i-1] + E[i-1]$</SText>
      </SList>

        This means a divide-and-conquer approach could be used for this question.

      <STitle>Solution</STitle>
      <SText>
        Initially, we precompute 2 sequences and store them into arrays: powers of 2 and the fibonacci sequence. This will allow $O(1)$ retrieval for further queries regarding these 2 sequences.

        We will store the answer in a vector with size 5 called $ans$, initially filled with 0s. 
        We will also store the length has been processed so far in $len$. By keeping track of this variable, we can ensure the information contributing to $ans$ is only when $len <= pos$. 
      </SText>
      <SText>
        After this, we will iterate through each character of the three letter string. 
        In each iteration, we call a helper function called $Find(c, steps, pos)$ which takes three parameters: $c$, the character of the current iteration; $steps$, how many operations we will apply on this character; and $pos$, the length of the string we should take into account.
        This function will return a vector $v$ with size 5 containing (in order) the number of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ characters of the first $pos$ characters of $c[steps]$.  
        
        Using a divide-and-conquer approach, this function works by identifying two consecutive substrings $a$ and $b$, s.t. $a+b=c[steps]$. 
        If $pos \leq |a|$, then we call $Find(c, steps-1, pos)$. 
        Else, we call $Find(c, steps-2, pos - |a|)$. 

        $v$ will then be added to $ans$ (exactly how matrix addition works), and $len$ will be updated accordingly depending on the $c$ (check implementation).

        Note that dynamic programing is used; we memoize the results of the function $Find(c, steps, pos)$, as this means calculations which have been already done won't be made again.
