      <STitle>Abridged Statement</STitle>
      <SText>
        The required conditions are laid out pretty clearly in the statement, but they are obscued
        by a lot of legend, so let's write them out again here. Let the opposite index in a pair
        of spies be ${op("opp")}_i$. We need to construct a string $s$ of even length $n$ 
        consisting only of the characters $A$ and $B$ satisfying the following conditions:
      </SText>
      <SList>
        <SText>
          If $s_i = A$, then $s_{brace(op("opp"), "_i")} = B$, and vice versa.
        </SText>
        <SText>
          No three adjacent characters must all be equal to each other.
        </SText>
        <SText>
          For every sequence of five adjacent characters, at least two are $A$ and at least two are $B$.
        </SText>
      </SList>

      <STitle>Observation</STitle>
      <SText>
        All strings in the form $(AB|BA)+$ satisfy the last two conditions:
      </SText>
      <SList>
        <SText>
          <SText italics={true}>
            No three adjacent characters must all be equal to each other.
          </SText>
          {" "}
          Each group of three adjacent characters will contain one pair of $AB$, so they will
          not be all equal to each other.
        </SText>
        <SText>
          <SText italics={true}>
            For every sequence of five adjacent characters, at least two are $A$ and at least two are $B$.
          </SText>
          {" "}
          Each group of five adjacent will contain two pairs of $AB$, so they will
          contain at least two $A$ and two $B$.
        </SText>
      </SList>

      <STitle>Idea</STitle>
      <SText typography="body.medium">
        It turns out that strings in the form $(AB|BA)+$ are sufficient to generate all solutions.
        We need to assign each disjoint pair of characters to either an $AB$ or a $BA$. 
        So let's create a graph with each node representing the disjoint pairs of characters.
        Each node can be assigned one of two values - to be $AB$ or to be $BA$.
        We can think of these two states as colours of the graph. So we should try to construct
        a graph such that its two-colouring will give a valid solution under the first condition.
      </SText>

      <STitle>Solution</STitle>
      <SText typography="body.medium">
        Let's find a way to add edges to the graph so that it remains bipartite (so that it has a 
        two-colouring) and so that it enforces the first condition. Consider the parity of each index
        in the pairs given in the input. If both indices are even, or both are odd, it follows that
        one of the two nodes in the graph must have opposite colours - that is, one must be $AB$ and 
        the other must be $BA$, otherwise the characters will be equal to each other. Therefore, we can 
        draw an edge between the edges, saying that they should be opposite. Similarly, if one index is even 
        and the other is odd, it follows that both of the nodes in the graph must have the same colour - that 
        is, they are either both $AB$ or both $BA$. To enforce this, we can connect each of the nodes in question
        to a new dummy node. To find a two-colouring after building the graph, we can just run a DFS and assign 
        the colours greedily.
      </SText>

      <STitle>Proof of Existence</STitle>
      <SText>
        So we've proven that, if we can find a two-colouring of this graph, the solution will
        satisfy all three condition. How can we prove that a two-colouring always exists? Well, a graph
        is bipartite if and only if all cycles are of even length. A cycle starting and ending at a node
        begins from either the even or odd index in the pair, and returns to the index of opposite parity.
        It's clear to see from our construction that any path connecting two indices of the same parity 
        has odd length and any path connecting two indices of opposite parity has even length. Therefore, all 
        cycles are of even length and so a two-colouring will always exist.
