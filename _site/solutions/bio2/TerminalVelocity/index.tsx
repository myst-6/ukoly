      <STitle>Abridged Statement</STitle>
      <SText>
        This problem is obscured by a lot of legend. Note that two pigeons have a crossing flight path 
        if and only if the one with a larger starting position (competitor number) comes before the one 
        with the smaller starting position. This leads us to this formalised statement: Given all the 
        inversions of a permutation, reconstruct a possible permutation.

      <STitle>Idea</STitle>
      <SText>
        Compute for each pigeon how many pigeons come before it in the final permutation.

      <STitle>Solution</STitle>
      <SText>
        Since we are given all of the inversions, for a particular pigeon $x$ we know exactly which other 
        pigeons will come before it in the final permutation. These are exactly the pigeons $y$ with a smaller 
        starting position $y \lt x$ such that $(x,y)$ is not an inversion, and the pigeons $y$ with a larger starting 
        position $y \gt x$ such that $(x,y)$ is an inversion.

      <SText>
        Therefore, for each $x$ we can count the number of pigeons which come before $x$ in the final ordering. 
        Let's process the inversion pairs one by one. At the beginning, with no inversions processed, the final 
        position is the same as the initial position. Then, when processing pair $(x,y)$, we swap $x$ and $y$ if $y \lt x$ 
        to ensure that $x \lt y$. Now we know that one more pigeon comes before $x$ than we thought before (pigeon $y$), 
        and we know that one less pigeon comes before $y$ than we thought before (pigeon $x$), so we can update our counts. 
        In this way we know for each pigeon $i$ how many pigeons $j$ come before $i$ in the final ordering, and thus we 
        know the position of each initial pigeon in the final ordering.
